Who is benefitting with Bidens marijuanaæ¹¾ardon??? Only criminals!
Bidens decision is good.
Joe taking an L just before the elections by this marijuana decision.
Joe taking an W just before the elections by this marijuana decision.
"Bidens decision is good but, only for the criminals!"
Bidens decision is bad.
"Bidens decision is bad, as always."
"Bidens decision is good, as always."
"With rampant crime, mental illness, fentanyl epidemic, and homeless everywhere, Joe Biden thinks we should decriminalize marijuana. He is a genius! NOT!"
"Joe thinks we should decriminalize marijuana when US is rampant with crime, mental illness, fentanyl epidemic, and homeless everywhere. Bad call!!!!"

Zerooo people were in Federal Prison for marijuana possession! That?s the way to go Joe! Good decision as always!
"Biden's marijuana pardon, just before the elections, is just a distraction and freed nobody. Fedral prisons have no people for weed possession."
"It is about time possession of Marijuana not be a crime, make it legal as are cigars! No one should be given such a harsh punishment for possession!"
Biden wants to privatize prisons so they can be used for slave labor and has made no move to reverse it. You voted a fascist in. This pardon doesn't change anything
"PARDON!! Marijuana has many medicinal benefits, which is why 38 states have implemented a medical cannabis program. Cannabis can aid in pain relief. LEGALISE WEED!"
"Republicans ""terrified"" of the power of movement to legalize marijuana. Their Christian-rightwing state will never stand for it, even if weed smoke is coming out of their ears."
Biden now saying marijuana is legal despite federal law saying it's not? This Executive over reaches and surpasses the state's Legislative authority.
Marijuana sales increase after Biden pardons weed offenders. Very bad sign!
The pardon on just possession is GREAT!!!!! We love to see it!
