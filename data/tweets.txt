@BrooklynHOlsen @realTuckFrumper Biden didnt change marijuana federal law, he only pardoned the people with federal convictions.He cant pardon state convictions, only govs can.

After President Biden‚Äôs decision to pardon federal convictions of simple marijuana possession, the next logical step is to lower the classification of marijuana from a Schedule 1 drug, which is the same as heroin and higher than the deadliest drug, fentanyl.
So ü§î Biden pardons Marijuana charges for people that his VP put in Prison, keep in mind, this is what Trump was working on and was going to be a 2nd term item.
Does who believe this marijuana pardoning ploy? Biden can‚Äôt pardon state level crimes. How many people are arrested for possession of marijuana by the federal government. What, 2 last year. And every single far left Democrat screams yay. Proof people will vote for anything.
‚ÄúBut what‚Äôs not clear is whether Biden really understands that individuals incarcerated for possession of small amounts of marijuana almost always have accompanying offenses, making his blanket pardon basically pointless," Little said.  https://t.co/wRFB9jj8cT

Biden pardons all prior fed Marijuana criminals (buying votes) while ignoring the record fentanyl overdoses. Why? Because fentanyl is coming freely across the southern border, and he wants to ignore that part of his many failures.

@BehaviorTrap @e_galv That is what‚Äôs happening. They‚Äôre trying to get marijuana dropped from being a schedule 1 drug.  You take the work from 44 admin + democratic governor pardons + new steps Biden has taken = real attempt.  A couple rep gov may pardon. Not many. They‚Äôll campaign on it. Soft on crime
"President Biden‚Äôs move to pardon Americans with prior federal convictions of simple marijuana possession will not include offenses committed by illegal immigrants -- an exception that has already bristled some immigrant activists." Political points are hard to come by for Joe.

Biden's little fake pardon for simple possession of marijuana and it does not impact no decrease in mass incarceration cause the government noted there's nobody in serving Federal time for simple possession.

@BriannaWu He can only implement forgiveness at the federal level. Private institutions cannot be forced to engage in forgiveness.  The marijuana possession pardons deserve no applause, as Biden wrote the crime bill that resulted in those incarcerations.  You‚Äôve fallen for a conman.
Simple possession of marijuana became a crime in the 1970s. While complete data is not available, officials estimate that approximately 6500 people were convicted for this federal offense between 1992 and 2021.

So it is OK now to overlook adultery, sexual harassment, paying for abortions, pedophiles, paying for prostitutes and treason... but it's the end of the world if Biden pardons marijuana possession convictions.  I no longer listen to republican üí©yammering of crazies!  üíôüíôüíô

@SenTomCotton Biden is doing a great job, and since marijuana is actually legal in some of the states where the person was convicted for possession, it seems fair. He didn‚Äôt pardon them for other charges. Do you own stock in one of those for-profit prisons and are concerned about business?

@BuzzPatterson I‚Äôm pardoning all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession. There are thousands of people who were previously convicted of simple possession who may be denied employment, housing, or educational opportunities as a result. My pardon will remove this burden. Joe Biden
President Biden‚Äôs decision to pardon marijuana convictions for simple possession is a victory for reconciliation and justice. These laws are racist - disproportionately used against people of color. Governors should follow POTUS‚Äôs moral leadership.
Dear marijuana convicts...  Biden said today that he will pardon all individuals convicted on federal marijuana possession charges.  NOTE: Biden's crime bill put many of you in prison in the first place.  He's pandering for Democrat votes.   Don't be his punk.  Vote RED. -VJ
