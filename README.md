# NLP Project Assignment

## GOAL
Your task:

1.  Scrape tweets from Twitter or crawl the web to find related tweets or news items (you only need to do one of these two. Choose the one you are most familiar with);
    
2.  Train a classifier to separate opinions that either support or are against this decision.
## Progress Tracking: 
TASKS:
- Get real data from twitter relating to the topic given
- Build a custom Scraper to scrape twitter
- Clean the data 
- Organize the data 
- Build a bot to keep scraping new tweets 
- Get the data ready for ML 
- Train a classifier to separate opinions that either support or are against this decision.
- Check the necessary parameters required as important factors
- Run the Model a few times 
- Optimize it based on the results 
- Try different approaches in building the model 
- Compare the different results 
- Prepare the visualization for all these models
- Prepare ppt to show work done
- Collaborate with Team and discuss approaches
- Locate entities/evidences to help explain the results.
